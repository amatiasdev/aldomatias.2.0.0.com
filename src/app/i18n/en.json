      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need technical knowledge to maintain the automation?",
        "answer": "No. Every deliverable includes step-by-step documentation with screenshots. Plus, you get 1 week of support where I answer questions and make any adjustments you need."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if I'm not satisfied with the result?",
        "answer": "You receive the deliverable with revisions included until it works as you expected. No extra charge for adjustments within the original scope. If the project doesn't meet what was agreed, you don't pay."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you work with companies outside LATAM?",
        "answer": "Yes. I work 100% remotely with clients in LATAM, Europe, and the United States. Time zones are not a problem: I adapt to your schedule for meetings and deliverables."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why hire a freelancer instead of an agency?",
        "answer": "Direct communication with me, no middlemen or overhead. Faster response, greater accountability, and significantly lower costs. You talk to the person doing the work, not an account manager."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if I need support after delivery?",
        "answer": "Every project includes 1 week of post-delivery support. After that, I offer hourly support or monthly packages as needed. The included documentation allows your team to operate without depending on me."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do you protect my company's data?",
        "answer": "I sign NDAs before each project. I use encrypted connections, private repositories, and follow the security best practices I apply in OWASP audits. Your information is never shared with third parties."
